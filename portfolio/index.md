Recordings
---
I've been fortunate enough to work with some fantastic performers in and around the Frost School of Music, and have spent the previous couple of years as a recording engineer working in the music school's concert halls. In particular, I've taken a liking to recording live jazz - a few samples of my work (with links to the artists performing, if available) are below.


Electronics
---

A key facet of my undergraduate education has been coursework in audio electronics - everything from distortion boxes to mixers, filters to amplifiers, tubes to solid state - all of it pure analog. For selected works, circuit schematics and simulation results are below. A few of these designs actually got built, and they include pictures and measurements. You can also find the block diagram for one of my newest projects, a digitally controlled analog synth designed and built as modular 500 series components.
